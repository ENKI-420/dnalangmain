# Prompts from the Bleeding Edge - Task Definition

## Task Objective

Design, implement, and validate a **DNA-Lang quantum swarm agent infrastructure platform** that:
- Enables multi-agent orchestration and self-evolution.
- Integrates real-time diagnostics, anomaly remediation, and profit optimization.
- Connects with production-grade APIs, databases, and cloud endpoints (no mocks or simulations).
- Is fully modular, auditable, and deployable in a live environment.

---

## Specific Requirements

1. **DNA-Lang Blueprints & Code**
    - All agents, organisms, genes, and collaborations must be defined using DNA-Lang syntax.
    - Explicit agent orchestration (agent classes, registry, roles, protocols).
    - Genes for real API integration (e.g., trading, diagnostics, cloud ops).
    - Collaborations for consensus, diagnostics, and profit-maximizing workflows.

2. **Production-Ready Integration**
    - All connections use live APIs and endpoints.
    - Secure secrets management (vault integration).
    - Real-time WebSocket and database logging.

3. **Diagnostics & Swarm Intelligence**
    - Implement a genomic diagnostic core (swirl, twin, immune shell, anomaly detection).
    - Swarm agents for distributed health monitoring, remediation, and optimization.

4. **Profit Maximization & Evolution**
    - Multi-agent profit consensus logic, leveraging parallel AI agents.
    - Genes for trading, tokenomics, cloud-architecture, and evolutionary strategies.

5. **Cloud-Native Deployment**
    - CI/CD pipelines for instant deployment to Vercel/AWS/GCP.
    - Security blueprint: PCI DSS, KYC/AML, audit logging, encrypted comms.

## Constraints

- **No mock or simulated data**—use only live, production-ready integrations.
- **All DNA-Lang organisms, genes, and collaborations must be explicit and modular.**
- **Code and blueprints must be annotated for clarity and auditability.**
- **Self-evolving, autonomous, and agentic platform design.**
- **All outputs must be deployable and extensible.**

---

## Success Criteria

- A complete, annotated DNA-Lang code archive implementing the quantum swarm agent infrastructure platform.
- All agents, genes, and collaborations are clearly defined and orchestrated.
- Platform is architected for live deployment, modular extension, and real-time diagnostics.
- All integrations (APIs, databases, websockets) are production-grade and secure.
- Documentation explains platform purpose, architecture, and deployment steps.

_This is the foundation for the next-gen, sovereign, agentic AI infrastructure—built from the bleeding edge._
